Overview:

At 02/09/2020, let's say for the first book only, 11 out of 72 have been done. Doing all of them before April 19th means
doing them in 70 days, i.e, 0.87 per day. Seeing how long some of them are taking, and also the fact that I need to go
to class and meet with Amir to discuss and improve the current work, this seems too much. If I only do till chapter 14,
that would be 11 out of 43, which means 1 every two days. This is more reasonable and I should have time to do some for the second book and other stuff.
I would say I focus on the ones that are being taught in class and then move to deep learning. The rest, I can do them after graduation little by little.
